# Bike-Rental-Prediction
Worked on a bike rental dataset with approximately 11,000 entries, developing regression algorithms to predict bike rentals based on weather conditions and seasons. Utilized Support Vector Machines (SVM), decision tree-based algorithm, and linear regression models for analysis. Assessed and compared predictive performance on a testing dataset, offering valuable insights for optimizing bike rental operations.
