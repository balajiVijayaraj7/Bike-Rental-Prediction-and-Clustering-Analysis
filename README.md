# Bike Rental Prediction and Clustering Analysis

## Introduction
Welcome to the Bike Rental Prediction and Clustering Analysis repository. Here, we delve into a comprehensive analysis of a bike rental dataset to predict the number of bikes rented in each time slot and perform clustering to uncover patterns within the data. This analysis aims to provide valuable insights into bike rental trends and groupings based on various factors.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of two main components: a training dataset with a target variable (number of bikes rented) and a testing dataset without the target variable. This information empowers us to develop robust predictive models for bike rentals and explore data clustering patterns.

## Task 1: Bike Rental Prediction using Regression Models

### Models Explored
1. **Linear Regression:** A fundamental regression technique that establishes a linear relationship between input features and the target variable.
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Kernel:** Employing SVM with kernel functions to capture complex relationships and predict bike rentals.
3. **Random Forest:** Leveraging an ensemble of decision trees for accurate predictions and handling non-linearities.

### Evaluation Approach
We will measure the performance of each model using standard regression evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2). The comparison of these metrics across the three models will gauge their effectiveness.

### Consistency of Predictions
The consistency of predictions across the three models will be analyzed by examining the distribution of predicted values on the testing dataset. This will help us understand how closely the models' predictions align.

## Task 2: Clustering Analysis

### Data Combination
The training and testing datasets will be merged to create a unified dataset for clustering analysis. This step prepares the data for identifying underlying patterns and groupings.

### Clustering Method
We will employ the K-means clustering algorithm to segment the data into distinct groups based on features. K-means aims to find natural clusters in the data.

### Cluster Validation
The validation of clusters will involve assessing whether the groups created effectively separate based on the target variable. Visualization and statistical analysis will guide this assessment.

## Conclusion
The Bike Rental Prediction and Clustering Analysis repository offers a comprehensive exploration of predicting bike rentals and uncovering meaningful data groupings. The regression models provide valuable insights into rental predictions, and the clustering analysis sheds light on hidden data patterns.
